The formal definition of database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of the database language. The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, the database schema. This describes how real world entities are modeled in the database.\n\n\n![][11]\n\n\n1.1.1 Type \n2\n \n3\n\n\nIn computer science and computer programming, a data type or simply type is a classification identifying one of various types of data, such as real, integer or Boolean, that determines the possible values for that type; the operations that can be done on values of that type; the meaning of the data; and the way values of that type can be stored.\n\n\nTEXT\n, \nINT\n, \nENUM\n, \nTIMESTAMP\n\n\n1.2 Cardinality (a.k.a Relationship) \n4\n\n\n![][12] \nForeign key\n, \nPrimary key\n\n\n1.2 Indexing\n\n\nA database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records. Why Indexing is important?\n\n\n![][13] \nIndexing in MySQL\n \n5\n Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly. Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first row and then read through the entire table to find the relevant rows. The larger the table, the more this costs. If the table has an index for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly determine the position to seek to in the middle of the data file without having to look at all the data. This is much faster than reading every row sequentially. ![][14]\n\n\nCREATE INDEX NameIndex ON Employee (name)\nSELECT * FROM Employee WHERE name = 'Ashish'\n\n\n\n\n2.

A transaction generally represents any change in database. Example: Transfer 900$ from Account\n\n\nBob\n to \nAlice\n \n7\n\n\nstart transaction\nselect balance from Account where Account_Number='Bob';\nselect balance from Account where Account_Number='Alice';\nupdate Account set balance=balance-900 here Account_Number='Bob' ;\nupdate Account set balance=balance+900 here Account_Number='Alice' ;\ncommit; //if all sql queries succed rollback; //if any of Sql queries failed or error\n\n\n\n\nACID Properties\n \n8\n\n\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction.\n\n\nFor example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction. ![][16]\n\n\n4. Backup and Restore \n9\n\n\nSometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When this state is needed, i.e., when it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are utilized to restore that state.\n\n\n5. Migration \n10\n\n\nIn software engineering, schema migration (also database migration, database change management) refers to the management of incremental, reversible changes to relational database schemas. A schema migration is performed on a database whenever it is necessary to update or revert that database's schema to some newer or older version. Example: Android Migration by droid-migrate\n\n\n11\n\n\ndroid-migrate init -d my_database droid-migrate generate up droid-migrate generate down\n\n\n\n\nExample: Database Seeding with Laravel \n12\n \nshell php artisan migrate:make seed_roles_table php artisan migrate:make seed_users_table php artisan migrate:reset php artisan db:seed\n\n\n6. Active record pattern | Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) \n13\n\n\nObject-relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a \"virtual object database\" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to create their own ORM tools.\n\n\n![][17] \nExample\n\n\nphp\n \n14\n\n\n$employee = new Employee(); $employee-\nsetName(\nJoe\n); $employee-\nsave();\n[/code]\n\n`Android` \nsup id=\nfnref-2159-10\na href=\n#fn-2159-10\n rel=\nfootnote\n15\n/a\n/sup\n\n\n```java\npublic class User {\n  @DatabaseField(id = true) String username;\n  @DatabaseField String password;\n  @DatabaseField String email;\n  @DatabaseField String alias;\n  public User() {} }\n\n\n\n\nImplementations\n\n\n\n\nAndroid: [ormlite-android][18] \n16\n\n\nPHP: [Eloquent][19]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nDatabase schema\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nData type\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nSQL Data Types for Various DBs\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nCardinality (data modeling)\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nHow MySQL Uses Indexes\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nCreate, read, update and delete\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nDatabase Transaction Tutorial in SQL with Example for Beginners\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nACID\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nDatabase\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nSchema migration\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \naglover/droid-migrate\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nDatabase Seeding with Laravel\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nObject-relational mapping\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nObject Relational Mapping in PHP\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nAn Android Repository with ORMLite (Using an existing SQLite database)\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n5 of the Best Android ORMs\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n \n\n  \n\n\n[1]: http://www.netsolutionsindia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Mongodb-Nosql.jpg\n[2]: http://www.oracle.com/index.html\n[3]: http://www.mysql.com/\n[4]: http://sqlite.org/\n[5]: http://redis.io/\n[6]: http://memcached.org/\n[7]: https://www.mongodb.org/\n[8]: http://neo4j.com/\n[9]: http://cassandra.apache.org/\n[10]: http://hbase.apache.org/\n[11]: http://i.imgur.com/uEuEdPv.png\n[12]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z6tTL.gif\n[13]: http://cdn.guru99.com/images/Index.jpg\n[14]: http://image.slidesharecdn.com/mysqlindex-091118043907-phpapp02/95/indexing-the-mysql-index-key-to-performance-tuning-17-638.jpg?cb=1357187786\n[15]: https://www.pingidentity.com/content/dam/pic/images/glyphs/22_Capabilities_UserProvisioningDeprovisioning_b3_r.png\n[16]: https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/y9qoNuNGdd9COo0twXUrefyy6ZKmRs3iFPIMKpJ7UZRXqX7Bc5lXFutzaKLFf0ZPD4Sl7uDj1CvQoCh2kOd9ZNkKokw_-xZ-QUwX8mWkKDexO0I58Oo\n[17]: https://symfony-docs-chs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/doctrine_image_1.png\n[18]: https://github.com/j256/ormlite-android\n[19]: http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/eloquent",

Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records. Why Indexing is important?  ![][13]  Indexing in MySQL   5  Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly. Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first row and then read through the entire table to find the relevant rows. The larger the table, the more this costs. If the table has an index for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly determine the position to seek to in the middle of the data file without having to look at all the data. This is much faster than reading every row sequentially. ![][14]  CREATE INDEX NameIndex ON Employee (name)\nSELECT * FROM Employee WHERE name = 'Ashish'",

A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OO programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] There is significant diversity in object-oriented programming, but most popular languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determines their type.\n\n\n\n\n1.

The features of encapsulation are supported using classes in most object-oriented programming languages, although other alternatives also exist. It allows selective hiding of properties and methods in an object by building an impenetrable wall to protect the code from accidental corruption.\n\n\n\n\nWhat it do?\n We will learn to hide unnecessary details in our classes and provide a clear and simple interface for working with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: A popular example you\u2019ll hear for encapsulation is driving a car. Do you need to know exactly how every aspect of a car works (engine, carburettor, alternator, and so on)? No - you need to know how to use the steering wheel, brakes, accelerator, and so on.\n\n\n\n2.2 Inheritance\n \n6\n \n7\n\n\nInheritance is when an object or class is based on another object (prototypal inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), using the same implementation (inheriting from an object or class) specifying implementation to maintain the same behavior (realizing an interface; inheriting behavior).\n\n\n\n\ninherit everything, add data or functionality, override functions, super\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat it do?\n We will explain how class hierarchies improve code readability and enable the reuse of functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: A real-world example of inheritance is genetic inheritance. We all receive genes from both our parents that then define who we are. We share qualities of both our parents, and yet at the same time are different from them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: we might classify different kinds of vehicles according to the inheritance hierarchy. Moving down the hierarchy, each kind of vehicle is both more specialized than its parent (and all of its ancestors) and more general than its children (and all of its descendants). A wheeled vehicle inherits properties common to all vehicles (it holds one or more people and carries them from place to place) but has an additional property that makes it more specialized (it has wheels). A car inherits properties common to all wheeled vehicles, but has additional, more specialized properties (four wheels, an engine, a body, and so forth). The inheritance relationship can be viewed as an is-a relationship. In this relationship, the objects become more specialized the lower in the hierarchy you go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the image above you will get a point.\n8\n Yes, the derived class can access base class properties and still the derived class has its own properties.\n\n\n\n2.3 Abstraction\n\n\nIn computer science, abstraction is a technique for managing complexity of computer systems. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level. The programmer works with an idealized interface (usually well defined) and can add additional levels of functionality that would otherwise be too complex to handle.\n\n\n\n\nWhat it do?\n We will learn how to work through abstractions: to deal with objects considering their important characteristics and ignore all other details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: You'll never buy a \"device\", but always buy something more specific : iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Nokia 3310... Here, iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and Nokia 3310 are concrete things, device is abstract.\n\n\n\n2.4 Polymorphism\n \n9\n\n\nPolymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. A polymorphic type is one whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type, or types.\n\n\n\n\nWhat it do?\n We will explain how to work in the same manner with different objects, which define a specific implementation of some abstract behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n: All animal can speak, but dogs woof, cats meow, and ducks quack\n\n\n\nThere are two types of polymorphism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverloading (compile time polymorphism): methods have the same name but different parameters.\n\n\nOverriding (run time polymorphism): the implementation given in base class is replaced with that in sub class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n \n10\n: Let us Consider Car example for discussing the polymorphism. Take any brand like Ford, Honda, Toyota, BMW, Benz etc., Everything is  of type Car.\nBut each have their own advanced features and more advanced technology involved in their move behavior.\n\n\n\n3. Concepts\n\n\nLearn Object Oriented Programming though \nMario Game\n\n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBbzYKMfx5Y[/embed]\n\n\nHow Mario get \n1up\n\n\n\n\n3.1. Object\n \n11\n\n\n\n  Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.\n\n\n\n\nIn mario world, \nMario is an object.\n\n\n Goomba is an object. \n Koopa is also an object. Even a coin\n and a pile \n are objects\n\n\n\n\n  Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of \nstate\n and related \nbehavior\n.\n\n  An object stores its \nstate\n in \nfields\n (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its \nbehavior\n through \nmethods\n (functions in some programming languages). Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication. Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation \u2014 a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.\n\n\n\n\nIn Mario world, \nMario \n has some fields like position (which indicate where Mario stands), state (which indicate whether Mario alive), and some methods like walk \n, fire or jump.\n\n\n\n\nGoomba \n has some fields like position (which indicate where Goomba stands), state (which indicate whether Goomba die), and direction (which indicate the direction Goomba moves). Goomba has move method, and jumped_on method (which occurs when it is jumped on by Mario) (Poor Goomba!)\n\n\n\nMario Objects, real scene\n\n\n\n3.2 Class\n \n12\n\n\n\n\nIn the real world, you'll often find many individual objects all of the same kind. There may be thousands of other bicycles in existence, all of the same make and model. Each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and therefore contains the same components. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.\n\n\n\n\nIn Mario world, each coin object come from Coin class, and every Koomba come from Koomba class\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Inheritance\n \n13\n\n\n\n\nInheritance is a mechanism in OOP to design two or more entities that are different but share many common features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature common to all classes are defined in the \nsuperclass\n\n\nThe classes that inherit common features from the \nsuperclass\n are called \nsubclasses\n\n\n\n\nIn Mario World, \nGoomba\n and \nKoopa\n is in\n\n\n\nAND MANY, MANY MORE\n\n\n\n\n3.4. Association, Aggregation and Composition\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nAssociation\n:\n\n\nWhenever two objects are related with each other the relationshiop is called association between object\n\n\nAggregation\n:\n\n\nAggregation is specialized from of association. In aggregation objects have their own life-cycle but there is ownership and child object can not belongs to another parent object. But this is only an ownership not the life-cycle control of child control through parent object.\n\n\nExample: Student and Teacher, Person and address\n\n\nComposition\n\n\nComposition is again specialize form of aggregation and we can call this as `life and death`` relationship. It is a strong type of aggregation. Child object does not have their life-cycle and if parent object is deleted, all child object will also be deleted.\n\n\nExample: House and room\n\n\n3.5 Polymorphism\n \n13\n\n\nPolymorphism indicates the meaning of \"many forms\"\n\n\nPolynorphism present a method that can have many definitions. Polymorphism is related to \"over loading\" and \"over ridding\".\n\n\nOverloading indicates a method can have different definitions by defining different type of parameters.\n\n\n[code]\ngetPrice(): void\ngetPrice(string name): void\n[/code]\n\n\n3.6 Abstraction\n \n13\n\n\nAbstraction is the process of modelling only relevant features\n\n\n\n\nHide unnecessary details which are irrelevant for current purpose.\n\n\n\n\nReduces complexity and aids understanding.\n\n\nAbstraction provides the freedom to defer implementation decisions by avoiding commitments to details.\n\n\n3.7 Interface\n \n13\n\n\nAn interface is a contract consisting of group of related function prototypes whose usage is defined but whose implementation is not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interface definition specifies the interface's member functions, called methods, their return types, the number and types of parameters and what they must do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese is no implementation associated with an interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Coupling and Cohesion\n\n\n13\n\n\n4.1 Coupling\n\n\nCoupling defines how dependent one object on another object (that is uses).\n\n\nCoupling is a measure of strength of connection between any two system components. The more any one components knows about other components, the tighter (worse) the coupling is between those components.\n\n\n4.2 Cohesion\n\n\nCohesion defines how narrowly defined an object is. Functional cohesion refers measures how strongly objects are related.\n\n\nCohesion is a measure of how logically related the parts of an individual components are to each other, and to the overall components. The more logically related the parts of components are to each other higher (better) the cohesion of that components.\n\n\n4.3 Object Oriented Design\n\n\nLow coupling and tight cohesion is good object oriented design.\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\n\nTask 1\n: With boiler plate code, make an gif image (32x32) Mario fire ball and jump to get coins\n\n\n5.

UML provides class diagram, object diagram to support this.\n\n\nImplementation\n defines the components assembled together to make a complete physical system. UML component diagram is used to support implementation perspective.\n\n\nProcess\n defines the flow of the system. So the same elements as used in Design are also used to support this perspective.\n\n\nDeployment\n represents the physical nodes of the system that forms the hardware. UML deployment diagram is used to support this perspective.\n\n\n\n\nModelling Types\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nDiagrams\n\n\nUsecase Diagram\n\n\n3\n \n4\n \n5\n\n\n\n\nA \nuse case\n diagram at its simplest is a \nrepresentation of a user's interaction\n with the system that shows the \nrelationship between the user\n and the \ndifferent use cases\n in which the user is involved.\n\n\nA use case diagram can identify the different types of users of a system and the different use cases and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse case diagrams depict:\n\n\n\n\nUse cases.\n A use case describes a sequence of actions that provide something of measurable value to an actor and is drawn as a horizontal ellipse. \n(example)\n\n\nActors.\n An actor is a person, organization, or external system that plays a role in one or more interactions with your system. Actors are drawn as stick figures. \n(example)\n\n\nAssociations.\n Associations between actors and use cases are indicated in use case diagrams by solid lines. An association exists whenever an actor is involved with an interaction described by a use case. Associations are modeled as lines connecting use cases and actors to one another, with an optional arrowhead on one end of the line. The arrowhead is often used to indicating the direction of the initial invocation of the relationship or to indicate the primary actor within the use case. The arrowheads are typically confused with data flow and as a result I avoid their use. \n(example)\n\n\nExtend\n: Extend is a directed relationship that specifies how and when the behavior defined in usually supplementary (optional) extending use case can be inserted into the behavior defined in the extended use case. \n(example)\n\n\nInclude\n is a directed relationship between two use cases which is used to show that behavior of the included use case (the addition) is inserted into the behavior of the including (the base) use case. \n(example)\n\n\nSystem boundary boxes\n (optional). You can draw a rectangle around the use cases, called the system boundary box, to indicates the scope of your system. Anything within the box represents functionality that is in scope and anything outside the box is not. System boundary boxes are rarely used, although on occasion I have used them to identify which use cases will be delivered in each major release of a system. \n(example)\n\n\nPackages\n (optional). Packages are UML constructs that enable you to organize model elements (such as use cases) into groups. Packages are depicted as file folders and can be used on any of the UML diagrams, including both use case diagrams and class diagrams. I use packages only when my diagrams become unwieldy, which generally implies they cannot be printed on a single page, to organize a large diagram into smaller ones. \n(example)\n\n\n\n\nClass Diagram\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nIn software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 UML Association \n9\n \n10\n\n\n\n\nAssociation\n\n\nAssociation is reference based relationship between two classes. Here a class A holds a class level reference to class B. Association can be represented by a line between these classes with an arrow indicating the navigation direction. In case arrow is on the both sides, association has bidirectional navigation.\n\n\n\n\nAggregation\n\n\nAggregation (shared aggregation)\n is a \"weak\" form of aggregation when part instance is independent of the composite:\n\n\n\n\nthe same (shared) part could be included in several composites, and\n\n\nif composite is deleted, shared parts may still exist.\n\n\n\n\nShared aggregation is shown as binary association decorated with a hollow diamond as a terminal adornment at the aggregate end of the association line. The diamond should be noticeably smaller than the diamond notation for N-ary associations. Shared aggregation is shown as binary association decorated with a hollow diamond.\n\n\n\n\nComposition\n\n\nComposition (composite aggregation) is a \"strong\" form of aggregation. Composition requirements/features listed in UML specification are:\n\n\n\n\nit is a whole/part relationship,\n\n\nit is binary association\n\n\npart could be included in at most one composite (whole) at a time, and\n\n\nif a composite (whole) is deleted, all of its composite parts are \"normally\" deleted with it.\n\n\n\n\nNote, that UML does not define how, when and specific order in which parts of the composite are created. Also, in some cases a part can be removed from a composite before the composite is deleted, and so is not necessarily deleted as part of the composite.\n\n\n\n\nAggregation vs Composition\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\nSequence Diagram\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nA Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.

A use case diagram can identify the different types of users of a system and the different use cases and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well.     Use case diagrams depict:   Use cases.  A use case describes a sequence of actions that provide something of measurable value to an actor and is drawn as a horizontal ellipse.  (example)  Actors.  An actor is a person, organization, or external system that plays a role in one or more interactions with your system. Actors are drawn as stick figures.  (example)  Associations.  Associations between actors and use cases are indicated in use case diagrams by solid lines. An association exists whenever an actor is involved with an interaction described by a use case. Associations are modeled as lines connecting use cases and actors to one another, with an optional arrowhead on one end of the line. The arrowhead is often used to indicating the direction of the initial invocation of the relationship or to indicate the primary actor within the use case. The arrowheads are typically confused with data flow and as a result I avoid their use.  (example)  Extend : Extend is a directed relationship that specifies how and when the behavior defined in usually supplementary (optional) extending use case can be inserted into the behavior defined in the extended use case.  (example)  Include  is a directed relationship between two use cases which is used to show that behavior of the included use case (the addition) is inserted into the behavior of the including (the base) use case.  (example)  System boundary boxes  (optional). You can draw a rectangle around the use cases, called the system boundary box, to indicates the scope of your system. Anything within the box represents functionality that is in scope and anything outside the box is not. System boundary boxes are rarely used, although on occasion I have used them to identify which use cases will be delivered in each major release of a system.  (example)  Packages  (optional). Packages are UML constructs that enable you to organize model elements (such as use cases) into groups. Packages are depicted as file folders and can be used on any of the UML diagrams, including both use case diagrams and class diagrams. I use packages only when my diagrams become unwieldy, which generally implies they cannot be printed on a single page, to organize a large diagram into smaller ones.  (example)",

Association can be represented by a line between these classes with an arrow indicating the navigation direction. In case arrow is on the both sides, association has bidirectional navigation.   Aggregation  Aggregation (shared aggregation)  is a \"weak\" form of aggregation when part instance is independent of the composite:   the same (shared) part could be included in several composites, and  if composite is deleted, shared parts may still exist.   Shared aggregation is shown as binary association decorated with a hollow diamond as a terminal adornment at the aggregate end of the association line. The diamond should be noticeably smaller than the diamond notation for N-ary associations. Shared aggregation is shown as binary association decorated with a hollow diamond.   Composition  Composition (composite aggregation) is a \"strong\" form of aggregation. Composition requirements/features listed in UML specification are:   it is a whole/part relationship,  it is binary association  part could be included in at most one composite (whole) at a time, and  if a composite (whole) is deleted, all of its composite parts are \"normally\" deleted with it.   Note, that UML does not define how, when and specific order in which parts of the composite are created. Also, in some cases a part can be removed from a composite before the composite is deleted, and so is not necessarily deleted as part of the composite.   Aggregation vs Composition  11",
